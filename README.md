# ANTRLR D Target

The ANTLR D Target represents an full featured and tested port of ANTLR 4.

This covers the runtime library, the tool to translate the syntax into D code and the tests for the runtime library.
See also [ANTLR version 4.9.2](http://www.antlr.org/).

Like other language ports, this D runtime library uses UTF-8.

## Install

1. Download or clone the package
2. Change directory to the root of the package and call **dub**.
3. You will find the generated ANTLR D-runtime library in lib/libantlr-d.a
4. The ANTLR tool for D will be generated by **make build_examples**
   (**./build.ps1 build_examples** on windows)
   in build/antlr4-4.9.2/tool/target/antlr4-4.9.2-SNAPSHOT-complete.jar

Consider providing a shortcut to make it easy to use ANTLR.
For example, define an alias:

    alias antlr4='java -jar path/to/build/antlr-d/build/antlr4-4.9.2/tool/target/antlr4-4.9.2-SNAPSHOT-complete.jar'

### Dependencies

#### ANTLR tool

- java 1.8
- maven
- 7-Zip (Only on windows)

## Examples

Check out the two simple but complete examples:

1. [Building a Calculator Using a Listener]
2. [Building a Calculator Using a Visitor]

## Extension versus other ANTLR runtime versions

The data type to store text is [Variant](https://dlang.org/phobos/std_variant.html).
This is handy for the rewriting feature on an indent-based syntax like Python.
In this case we need a structure representing the text as well as the number of indents.
